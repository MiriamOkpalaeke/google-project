You will be working on designing a google search page. Let’s get started.

• Visit <a href="http://www.google.com/"><b><u class="cdx-underline">google.com</u></b></a> and search for either Lionel Messi or Christiano Ronaldo.&nbsp;
• Using HTML and CSS, redesign just the first page of your search result
• Video content in your search result should be replaced with images if you cannot add the actual video content to your design
Scoring Criteria

We would be looking out for;

• How you sectionalize your pages
• Use of font
• Closeness of your design to the search result.
Good luck!!
